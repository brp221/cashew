PROJECT DIRECTORY ANATOMY (currently)

 --> Data Pipeline ( all of the data sciency stuff happens here. Noah, Slav and Val will be working here primarily)

          --> 4 NBs ( 4 automated R Scripts which will be scheduled to run every 24 or 12 hours. They pull in data from FMP, package it and ship it to a Relational DB )

                        --> healthiestCompaniesSifter.R
          
          --> Research and Analysis ( This is where we will be analyzing data, looking for patterns and generating models. We will also probably draft graph layouts for client-side here)
                        --> marketAnalysis.R

          --> DatabaseDesign 
  
  --> Shiny Dashboard ( you can run this if you like it's just an R Shiny Application that I showed you. We can use this internally to explore data)

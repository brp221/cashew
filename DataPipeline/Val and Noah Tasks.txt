VAL AND NOAH 2 DOs
 
Noah :
1. Go over my KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and validate that they make sense.  Obviously its not an exact science but if you think that      
we'd be better off having one KPI over another OR if we should add a new KPI OR just completely eliminate one, let me know which one and 
your reasoning behind it. 


Val :
1. In marketAnalysis.R, graph KPIs of interest so that we can establish any patterns, categorizations and indications. 
Analysis <- (distributions and correlations suggested, others welcome)
KPIs <- (InsiderTrading, DCF, RevGrowth, NetIncomeGrowth suggested. Other KPIs of your interest are also encouraged)

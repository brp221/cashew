 (1) GENERAL PITCH 
      - motivation : 
            - uncle in Savannah
            - not many investment products for the middle class. Most are for wealth managment firms. Blackrock's Alladin, Bloomberg                          
              Terminal, Koyfin. I dont care about making the rich any richer than they already are. 
      - Talk about current "investment" products: Yahoo Fin, Alpha,Koyfin, Wall Street (expensive)
            - great research tools. Wealth/ Pollution of Data( Knowledge). Depends on your perspective and who you are
            - subscriptions aren't appealing YF: 25$, SeekingAlpha: 20$, SimplyWallStreet $20/month . That is a high tax, even if the investor                
              is gaining $200 montly. Not to mention the cost of time and effort spent in the meantime 
            - UGLY IMPRACTICAL UIs
      - what we will provide that is DIFFERENT:
            1. Other platforms put it on the user to do their research. We "sift the gold" already
                  -introduce goldPanner.R
                  -minimaslistic ( "There's beauty in simplicity") ( "QUALITY OVER QUANTITY" )
            2. Many Different Approaches to Investing
                  -Discount Investing (Intrinsic Value) 
                  -Biggest Growth Investing

                  -Earning Calendar +  Other Types of Sentiment investing 
                  -Technical Investing Support ( for more intensive investors )
            3. Focused on the needs of the average joe. 
                  -Our platform will save time for the middle class working 9-5s 
                  -Most people are scared of what they dont know. We present content in an approachable, friendly manner
                  -Educative Tool
            4. Price Moat 
                  - Ideally,depending on cost of production, our services would be in the price range of a Starbucks Latte
             
 (2) FMP API 
      - Show data available to us : ? SHINY DASHBOARD ?
      - would you guys like to take a look at the FMP Documentation ? 
      - Show what we would be able to do with it :
          - Present USER INTERFACE draft which will act as an investment reccomender/ assistant 
          - Create an actual automated trading bot ( Tech analysis w FMPC API) : https://exploringfinance.github.io/fmpcloudr/#technical-indicators
          - Physical products (something like apple-watch-esque : visual/auditory appeal?) (arduino prototype)
 
 (3) SHOW WHAT I HAVE DONE ALREADY 
      - The 4 Automated Notebooks 
      - Shiny Dashbaord

 (4) WORK TO BE DONE 
      1.Reasearch 
      1.UI execution 
      2.DB Integration. Added benefit of this is that by recording data we rely less on the FMP. Plus we get to keep historical data
